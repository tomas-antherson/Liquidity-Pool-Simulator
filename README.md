## üë®‚Äçüè´ Workshop
If you want to do the workshop check out the branch `Javaland4Kids`. In this state the game logic is missing and needs
to be implemented. Therefore, the tests are separated into 8 easy steps (`step1` - `step8`). Each step contains several
tests. Code until a step is running green:
```bash
./gradlew  jvmTest
```
After every step, you can run the game to check your progress. 
```bash
./gradlew  runJvm
```

## üß≠ Overview
The game runs in a game loop in the `GameFlow`.
The game logic and the model are separated from the rendering.
This allows to test the game without a UI.
A `EventBus` helps to decouple the components.
For easy dependency injection the `AsyncInjector` is used.

## üõ† Setup

You can open this project in IntelliJ IDEA by opening the folder or the `build.gradle.kts` file.
For Windows, change all the `./gradlew` for `gradlew.bat`.
You should use Gradle 7.5 or greater and Java 8 or greater.

To upgrade to a newer KorGE, change the plugin version in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

## üîä Audio

To mute sounds you can change `src/commonMain/kotlin/main.kt` and set `playSounds = false`.
Sounds and music can be also enabled in the game settings (‚öô gear icon).

## Compiling for the JVM (Desktop)

Inside IntelliJ you can go to the `src/commonMain/kotlin/main.kt` file and press the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon
that appears to the left of the `suspend fun main()` line.

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew runJvm                    # Runs the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJar          # Creates a FAT Jar with the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJarProguard  # Creates a FAT Jar with the program and applies Proguard to reduce the size
```

Fat JARs are stored in the `/build/libs` folder.

## Compiling for the Web

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew jsWeb                     # Outputs to /build/web
./gradlew jsWebMin                  # Outputs to /build/web-min (applying Dead Code Elimination)
./gradlew jsWebMinWebpack           # Outputs to /build/web-min-webpack (minimizing and grouping into a single bundle.js file)
./gradlew runJs                     # Outputs to /build/web, creates a small http server and opens a browser
```

You can use any HTTP server to serve the files in your browser.
For example using: `npm -g install http-server` and then executing `hs build/web`.

You can also use `./gradlew -t jsWeb` to continuously building the JS sources and running `hs build/web` in another terminal.
Here you can find a `testJs.sh` script doing exactly this for convenience.

You can run your tests using Node.JS by calling `jsTest` or in a headless chrome with `jsTestChrome`.

## Compiling for Native Desktop (Windows, Linux and macOS)

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableMacosX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/macosX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.kexe
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableLinuxX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/linuxX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.kexe
./gradlew linkDebugExecutableMingwX64         # Outputs to /build/bin/mingwX64/mainDebugExecutable/main.exe
```

Note that windows executables doesn't have icons bundled.
You can use [ResourceHacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to add an icon to the executable for the moment.
Later this will be done automatically.

### Cross-Compiling for Linux/Windows

If you have docker installed, you can generate native executables for linux and windows
using the cross-compiling gradle wrappers:

```bash
./gradlew_linux linkDebugExecutableLinuxX64   # Outputs to /build/web
./gradlew_win   linkDebugExecutableMingwX64   # Outputs to /build/web
```

### Generating MacOS `.app`

```bash
./gradlew packageMacosX64AppDebug             # Outputs to /build/unnamed-debug.app
```

You can change `Debug` for `Release` in all the tasks to generate Release executables.

You can use the `strip` tool from your toolchain (or in the case of windows found in the ``~/.konan` toolchain)
to further reduce Debug and Release executables size by removing debug information (in some cases this will shrink the EXE size by 50%).

In windows this exe is at: `%USERPROFILE%\.konan\dependencies\msys2-mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-7.3.0-clang-llvm-lld-6.0.1\bin\strip.exe`.

### Linux notes

Since linux doesn't provide standard multimedia libraries out of the box,
you will need to have installed the following packages: `freeglut3-dev` and `libopenal-dev`.

In ubuntu you can use `apt-get`: `sudo apt-get -y install freeglut3-dev libopenal-dev`.

## Compiling for Android

You will need to have installed the Android SDK in the default path for your operating system
or to provide the `ANDROID_SDK` environment variable. The easiest way is to install Android Studio.

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

### Native Android (JVM)

```bash
./gradlew installAndroidDebug             # Installs an APK in all the connected devices
./gradlew runAndroidEmulatorDebug         # Runs the application in an emulator
```

Triggering these tasks, it generates a separate android project into `build/platforms/android`.
You can open it in `Android Studio` for debugging and additional tasks. The KorGE plugin just
delegates gradle tasks to that gradle project.

### Apache Cordova (JS)

```bash
./gradlew compileCordovaAndroid           # Just compiles cordova from Android
./gradlew runCordovaAndroid               # Runs the application (dce'd, minimized and webpacked) in an Android device
./gradlew runCordovaAndroidNoMinimized    # Runs the application in Android without minimizing (so you can use `chrome://inspect` to debug the application easier)
```



## Compiling for iOS

You will need XCode and to download the iOS SDKs using Xcode.

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

### Native iOS (Kotlin/Native) + Objective-C

Note that the necessary bridges are built using Objective-C instead of Swift, so the application
won't include Swift's runtime.

```bash
./gradlew iosBuildSimulatorDebug          # Creates an APP file
./gradlew iosInstallSimulatorDebug        # Installs an APP file in the simulator
./gradlew iosRunSimulatorDebug            # Runs the APP in the simulator

```

These tasks generate a xcode project in `build/platforms/ios`, so you can also open the project
with XCode and do additional tasks there.

It uses [XCodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for the project generation
and [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy) for deploying to real devices.

### Apache Cordova (JS)

```bash
./gradlew compileCordovaIos               # Just compiles cordova from iOS
./gradlew runCordovaIos                   # Runs the application (dce'd, minimized and webpacked) in an iOS device
./gradlew runCordovaIosNoMinimized        # Runs the application in iOS without minimizing (so you can use Safari on macOS to debug the application easier)
```

## JS-game deployment to GitHub Pages

- Go to [settings page](../../settings) and enable GitHub Pages
- Choose branch `github-pages` and select folder `/ (root)`
- After that you can use link:  
  [link to JS-game](../../deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages), click "View Deployment"
- When you push to main or master branch, - deployment process will start again with GitHub Actions.
